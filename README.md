## Campus Placement Prediction

### Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict the success of students in securing campus placements. By analyzing various factors such as academic scores, specialization, work experience, and other personal attributes, we aim to understand what influences placement outcomes and develop models that can predict whether a student will get placed.

### Features
- Uses multiple machine learning models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree.
- Analyzes the impact of academic and personal factors on placement success.
- Visualizes key statistical insights to aid understanding of data features that influence placement.

### Prerequisites
You need to have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries used in the project. You can install all required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
